## Rules

1.  Your solutions must be written up in the R Markdown (Rmd) file called `exam-01.Rmd`.
    This file must include your code and write up for each task.
    Your "submission" will be whatever is in your exam repository at the deadline.
    Commit and push the Rmd and the md outputs of that file.

2.  This exam is open book, open internet, closed other people.
    You may use any online or book based resource you would like, but you must include citations for any code that you use (directly or indirectly).
    You **may not** consult with anyone else about this exam other than the Professor or TA for this course.
    You cannot ask direct questions on the internet, or consult with each other, not even for hypothetical questions.

3.  You have until **[DUE DATE]** to complete this exam and turn it in via your personal Github repo - late work will **not** be accepted.
    Technical difficulties are **not** an excuse for late work - do not wait until the last minute to knit / commit / push.

4.  Each question requires a (brief) narrative as well as a (brief) description of your approach.
    You can use comments in your code, but do not extensively count on these.
    I should be able to suppress **all** the code in your document and still be able to read and make sense of your answers.
    See the first setup code chunk in your Rmd file to experiment with suppressing and revealing your code.

5.  Even if the answer seems obvious from the R output, make sure to state it in your narrative as well.
    For example, if the question is asking what is 2 + 2, and you have the following in your document, you should additionally have a sentence that states "2 + 2 is 4."

``` r
2 + 2
# 4
```

1.  You may only use `tidyverse` and `nycflights13` (and its dependencies) for this assignment. Your solutions may not use any other R packages.

## Academic Integrity Statement

*I, Rachael Smith, hereby state that I have not communicated with or gained information in any way from my classmates or anyone other than the Professor or TA during this exam, and that all work is my own.*

**A note on sharing / reusing code:** I am well aware that a huge volume of code is available on the web to solve any number of problems.
For this exam you are allowed to make use of any online resources (e.g. StackOverflow) but you must explicitly cite where you obtained any code you directly use (or use as inspiration).
You are also not allowed to ask a question on an external forum, you can only use answers to questions that have already been answered.
Any recycled code that is discovered and is not explicitly cited will be treated as plagiarism.
All communication with classmates is explicitly forbidden.

## Getting help

You are not allowed to post any questions on the public community repo or the public questions channel on Slack.
Any questions about the exam must be asked in person in office hours or on Slack via direct message to the Professor or the TAs.
For quickest response we recommend that you start a direct message with the Professor and all the TAs so that whoever gets to it first can respond to you.

## Grading and feedback

The total points for the questions add up to 90 points.
The remaining 10 points are allocated to code style, commit frequency and messages, overall organization, spelling, grammar, etc.
There is also an extra credit question that is worth 5 points.
You will receive feedback as an issue posted to your repository, and your grade will also be recorded on Sakai.

## Logistics

Answer the questions in the document called `exam-01.Rmd`.
Add your code and narrative in the spaces below each question.
Add code chunks as needed.
Use as many lines as you need, but keep your narrative concise.

Before completing, make sure to supress the code and look over your answers one more time.
If the narrative seems sparse or choppy, edit as needed.
Then, revert back to revealing your code.

Don't forget that you will need to configure your user name and email for Git to be able to push to your repository.

## Packages

In addition to `tidyverse`, you will need the `nycflights13` package for the data.
You will first need to install these packages and then load them.

## The data

The `nycflights13` package contains information about all flights that departed from NYC (e.g. EWR, JFK and LGA) in 2013.
The main data is in the `flights` data frame, but there are additional data sets which may help understand what causes delays, specifically:

-   `weather`: hourly meteorological data for each airport
-   `planes`: construction information about each plane
-   `airports`: airport names and locations
-   `airlines`: translation between two letter carrier codes and names

## Questions

1.  **Question 1 (10 points)** - What are the ten most common destinations for flights from NYC airports in 2013?
    Make a table that lists these in descending order of frequency and shows the number of fligts heading to each airport.
    ***The ten most common destinations for flights from NYC airports in 2013 are ORD, ATl, LAX, BOS, MCO, CLT, SFO, FLL, MIA, and DCA. The first group of code views the data for the flights. Then the second group of code creates the table and show the most popular destinations in descending order.***

View(flights)



flights %>% 
  count(dest, name="number_flights_dest", sort = TRUE)

2.  **Question 2 (10 points)** - Which airlines have the most flights departing from NYC airports in 2013?
    Make a table that lists these in descending order of frequency and shows the number of flights for each airline.
    In your narrative mention the names of the airlines as well.
    *Hint:* You can use the `airlines` dataset to look up the airline name based on `carrier` code.
    ***The airlines that have the most flights departing from NYC airports in 2013 are United Air Lines Inc. 58665, JetBlue Airways 54635, and ExpressJet Airlines Inc. 54173. The code is a pipeline to separate the flights from NYC in 2013 and then put them in a table to sort them in descending order.***

inner_join(flights,airlines) %>% 
  count(name, name="number_flights_airline", sort = TRUE)


3.  **Question 3 (10 points)** - Consider only flights that have non-missing arrival delay information.
    Your answer should include the name of the carrier in addition to the carrier code and the values asked.

View(airlines)


    a\.
    Which carrier had the highest mean arrival delay?
 ***The carrier that had the highest mean arrival delay 21.9207 Frontier Airlines Inc. The code grouped it by the carrier and then by the mean of the carriers delays. This allowed me to not have to look through all the data it created a simple table.***

flights %>%
    group_by(carrier) %>%
    summarise(delay = mean(arr_delay, na.rm = TRUE)) %>%
    inner_join(airlines) %>% arrange(desc(delay)) %>% 
    slice_head(n = 1)

    b\.
    Which carrier had the lowest mean arrival delay?
***The carrier that had the lowest mean arrival delay -6.915205	Hawaiian Airlines Inc. The code kept everything the same for part A but changed the na.rm to FALSE***

flights %>%
    group_by(carrier) %>%
    summarise(delay = mean(arr_delay, na.rm = FALSE)) %>%
    inner_join(airlines) %>% arrange(desc(delay)) %>% 
    slice_head(n = 1)
  

4.  **Question 4 (10 points)** - What was the mean temperature at the origin airport on the day with the highest departure delay?
    Your answer should include the name of origin airport, the date with the highest departure delay, and the mean temperature on that day.
***The mean temperature for at Newark New Jersey (EWR) is 42.1. The code used very similar code for the question above. However it added a group by and added the temperature to the table.***

worst_day <-flights %>% 
  group_by(year,month,day) %>%
  summarise(max_dep_delay=max(dep_delay,na.rm=TRUE)) %>% 
  arrange(desc(max_dep_delay)) %>% 
  ungroup() %>% 
  slice_head(n = 1)


weather_most_delayed <-
  semi_join(weather, worst_day,
            by = c("year", "month", "day" )) %>% 
  group_by(origin) %>% 
  summarise(mean_temp=mean(temp, na.rm = TRUE))

5.  **Question 5 (15 points)** - Consider breaking the day into four time intervals: 12:01am-6am, 6:01am-12pm, 12:01pm-6pm, 6:01pm-12am.
***The code used the information in the question to break the day up into four intervals.***

flights_intervals <- flights %>%
    mutate(
        interval= case_when(
            dep_time <= 600 & dep_time >= 1 ~ "first_interval",
            dep_time >= 601 & dep_time <= 1200 ~ "second_interval",
            dep_time >= 1201 &  dep_time <= 1800 ~ "third_interval", 
            dep_time >= 1801 & dep_time <= 2400 ~ "fourth_interval")
        %>% factor(levels=c('first_interval', 'second_interval', 'third_interval',"fourth_interval")))
    a\.
    Calculate the proportion of flights that are delayed at departure at each of these time intervals.
  ***The proportion of flights that are delayed for interval one is 7.19%. The proportion for interval two 0.56%. The proportion for interval three is 1.8%. The proportion for interval four is 8.1%. The code created a table to show me the proportion of delays for each of the different intervals that were already coded above.***

flights_intervals %>% 
  group_by(interval) %>% 
  count(delayed_more_2h=dep_delay > 120) %>%
   add_count(interval, wt = n,
            name = "fligths_interval") %>% 
    mutate(prop = n/fligths_interval*100) %>% 
  drop_na()

    b\.
    Comment on how the likelihood of being delayed change throughout the day?
  ***The chance of your flight being delayed does change throughout the day. Your highest chance of getting a flight delayed is between hour 15 and 20. But overall there is a steady growth throughout the day. For the code I chose to make a graph to better show the pattern throughout the day.***

 flights_delayed %>% 
    filter(delay == 1) %>% 
    group_by(hour) %>% summarize(n_delays = n()) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x= hour, y = n_delays)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_line(col = "green")

6.  **Question 6 (15 points)** - Find the flight with the longest air time.

longest_distance<-flights %>% arrange( desc(distance)) %>% 
  slice_head(n=1) %>% pull(distance)
longest_destination<-flights %>% arrange( desc(distance)) %>% 
  slice_head(n=1) %>% pull(dest)
longest_origin<-flights %>% arrange( desc(distance)) %>% 
  slice_head(n=1) %>% pull(origin)
longest_seats <- inner_join(flights,planes, by="tailnum") %>% filter(tailnum=="N380HA") %>% pull(seats) %>% unique()

    a\.
    How long is this flight?
  ***The longest flight is 4983 miles***

    b\.
    What city did it fly to?
  ***The city that it flew to was HNL or Honolulu***

    c\.
    How many seats does the plane that flew this flight have?
  ***The plane has 377 seats.***

7.  **Question 7 (15 pts)** - The `airports` data frame contains information on a large number of primarily American airports.
    These data include location information for these airports in the form of latitude and longitude coordinates.
    In this question we limit our focus to the [Contiguous United States](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contiguous_United_States).
    Visualize and describe the distribution of the longitudes of airports in the Contiguous United States.
    What does this tell you about the geographical distribution of these airports?
    *Hint:* You will first need to limit your analysis to the Contiguous United States.
    [This Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_extreme_points_of_the_United_States) can help, but you're welcomed to use other resources as well.
    Make sure to cite whatever resource you use.
***This data shows that there are more airports on the coast. There is far less airports in the middle of the country. For my information I used the Wikipedia article in the question.***

flights_latlon <- flights %>%
    inner_join(select(airports, origin = faa, origin_lat = lat, origin_lon = lon),
               by = "origin"
    ) %>%
    right_join(select(airports, dest = faa, dest_lat = lat, dest_lon = lon,tzone),
               by = "dest"
    )


airports %>%
  filter(
    lat > 24.520833333333332 & lat < 49.38447222222222,
    lon > -124.77169444444445 & lon < -66.94702777777778
  ) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = lon)) +
    geom_histogram(binwidth = 5)

8.  **Question 8 (15 pts)** - Recreate the plot included below using the `flights` data.
    Once you have created the visualization, in no more than one paragraph, describe what you think the point of this visualization might be.
    *Hint:* The visualization uses the variable `arrival`, which is not included in the `flights` data frame.
    You will have to create `arrival` yourself, it is a categorical variable that is equal to `"ontime"` when `arr_delay <= 0` and `"delayed"` when `arr_delay > 0`.
    ***The whole idea of the visulaization is to show the delay for each of the locations shown***

flights %>% 
  filter(dest %in% c("PHL","RDU")) %>% 
  filter(month==12) %>% 
  mutate(
    Arrival= case_when(
            arr_delay <= 0 ~ "ontime",
            arr_delay > 0 ~ "delayed")) %>% 
  filter(!is.na(Arrival)) %>% 
          ggplot(aes(x=Arrival, y= dep_delay, color=dest))+
  geom_boxplot()+
  facet_grid(dest~origin)+
  
  labs(title="On time performance of NYC fligths",
       subtitle="December 2013",
  y="Departure delay", 
        color = "Destination")+
   coord_cartesian( ylim = c(0,200))

![](img/plot-to-recreate.png)

**Extra Credit (5 pts)** - Create a visualization that effectively shows if there is a relationship between the average daily departure delay and the average daily temperature for all three New York city airports.
Your answer must be given in a single pipe.
(You should only spend time on this question once you have finished answering the others)


flights_weather <- inner_join(flights, weather, by = c("year", "month", "day", "origin")) %>%
  group_by(month, day, origin) %>%
  summarise(avg_dep_delay = mean(dep_delay, na.rm = TRUE),
            avg_temp = mean(temp, na.rm = TRUE))

ggplot(flights_weather, aes(x = avg_temp, y = avg_dep_delay)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.5) +
  facet_wrap(~ origin) +
  labs(x = "Average Temperature", y = "Average Delay (min)")
